About a year ago I stumbled upon [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), a static site generator that puts performance first and uses GraphQL to build its data layer. My personal website was due for a rewrite and I played around with the framework. Sadly its TypeScript support was pretty much non-existent so I lost interest.

The Gatsby development team didn't lose interest luckily and TypeScript support has been (partially) added. Enough reason for me to try the framework again and write my new personal website. This blog post is a breakdown of how I used GatsbyJS to create my new website.
